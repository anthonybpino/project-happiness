# Project Happiness

## Project Description/Outline:

Using information from the 2023 World Happiness Report, we created several data visualizations in order to delve into each country's happiness score.  In additiona to allowing users to investigate the details of each country's happiness score, it also allows the user to examine the relationship between all of the included countries' happiness scores and the following variables from each country:

- Per Capita GDP
- Social Support
- Healthy Life Expectancy
- Freedom to Make Life Choices
- Generosity
- Perception of Corruption

Analysis of these relationships can be found in the "Visualizations & Analysis" section of this file.
